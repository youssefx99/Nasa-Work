          Water is essential for life, and it is important to understand how it
          is distributed on Earth. The vast majority of water on Earth is in the
          oceans, which account for about 97% of the total. The remaining 3% is
          freshwater, which is found in glaciers, ice caps, groundwater, lakes,
          rivers, and the atmosphere. Freshwater Freshwater is unevenly
          distributed on Earth. About 69% of freshwater is locked up in glaciers
          and ice caps, with most of the rest found in groundwater. Only a small
          fraction of freshwater is found in surface water bodies, such as lakes
          and rivers. Surf ace water Surface water is the most accessible form
          of freshwater, but it is also the most vulnerable to pollution and
          overuse. Rivers and lakes provide drinking water for billions of
          people, and they are also important for irrigation, transportation,
          and recreation. Groundwater Groundwater is water that is stored
          underground in aquifers. Aquifers are porous rock formations that can
          hold large amounts of water. Groundwater is a valuable source of
          drinking water, and it is also used for irrigation and industrial
          purposes. The water cycle The water cycle is the process by which
          water moves around the Earth. It is a continuous process that involves
          evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. Evaporation is
          the process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas. When water
          evaporates, it enters the atmosphere as water vapor. Condensation is
          the process by which water vapor changes back into a liquid. When
          water vapor condenses, it forms clouds. Precipitation is the process
          by which water falls from the sky as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.
          Runoff is the process by which water flows over the land surface and
          into rivers, lakes, and oceans. Climate change and water Climate
          change is having a significant impact on the distribution of water on
          Earth. Global warming is causing sea levels to rise, and it is also
          leading to more extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods.
          These changes are disrupting the water cycle and making it more
          difficult to manage water resources. Conclusion The distribution of
          water on Earth is uneven and becoming increasingly unpredictable due
          to climate change. It is important to understand how water is
          distributed and how it is being affected by climate change so that we
          can manage water resources sustainably. Here are some additional facts
          about the distribution of water on Earth: • About 1.386 billion cubic
          kilometers (333 million cubic miles) of water exists on Earth. • Only
          2.5% of Earth's water is freshwater. • Of the freshwater on Earth,
          68.7% is in glaciers and ice caps, 30.1% is in groundwater, and 1.2%
          is in surface water bodies. • The remaining freshwater is found in the
          atmosphere and in living organisms. • The average human uses about 150
          liters (40 gallons) of water per day. Water is a precious resource,
          and it is important to use it wisely. We can all do our part to
          conserve water by taking shorter showers, fixing leaky faucets, and
          watering our lawns less often.

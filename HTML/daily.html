          Freshwater is found in lakes, rivers, soil, snow, groundwater and ice,
          and is one of the most essential of Earth's resources, for drinking
          water and agriculture. However, the distribution of freshwater around
          the planet is changing. Researchers used a pair of satellites called
          the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, or GRACE, to track
          freshwater movement over the last fifteen years. The twin GRACE
          satellites were launched in 2002 as a joint mission between NASA and
          the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The two satellites precisely
          measured the distance between themselves to detect changes in Earth's
          gravity field caused by movements of mass on the planet below, caused
          by shifts in water and ice. They found that some regions' water
          supplies are relatively stable, others experienced increases or
          decreases. Climate change has driven freshwater loss from the ice
          sheets at the poles, which has implications for sea level rise. Other
          areas saw groundwater depletions because of humans using water for
          irrigating crops or increases due to higher amounts of rainfall
          because of natural variability. Watch the video to learn more.
